# PNW-Native-Images

This is a simple twitter bot, written in R to download and tweet images and descriptions from the University of Washington's American Indians of the Pacific Northwest's Digital Collection: https://content.lib.washington.edu/aipnw/index.html. 

I was motivated to build this because I love how these pictures capture formal and informal moments in native life in the Pacific Northwest. The pictures show the complexity and humanity of the people and cultures that exisited in the not too distant past. 

This was also a project to see if I could deploy a bot on Azure Functions. I relied heavily on the informaiton here: https://github.com/thdeltei/azure-function-r
